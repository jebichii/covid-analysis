# COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 trends using data visualization techniques. It covers total cases, deaths, new daily cases, death rates, and vaccination progress across selected countries.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across countries
- Visualize trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare daily new cases between countries
- Calculate and observe changes in death rates
- Understand vaccination rollout progress
- Use data-driven visuals to uncover insights

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (3.x)
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** – for visualizations
- **Seaborn** – for enhanced plots
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for development environment

## 📈 Key Insights
- North America had the largest number of people affected by COVID-19 during peak periods.
- Death rates vary significantly across countries and over time.
- Some countries experienced multiple waves of high daily new cases.
- Vaccination rollout timelines differ and impact the overall death rate trend.
- Data completeness is crucial — missing values can skew visualizations.
